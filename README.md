If you are using one of our pre-loaded SD cards, please follow these
steps to update your SD card to the latest resources:

This will download any updates to the resource packs, which
includes PDFs of workbooks, code, and all other required files.

If you need to completely reconstruct the card, please note all cards are
currently loaded with this image from the Raspberry Pi Foundation:
